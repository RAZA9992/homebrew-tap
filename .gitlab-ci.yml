# Define stages that will be executed in the CI/CD pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - release

# Define variables for reuse
variables:
  # Define the name of the binary produced by the build process
  BINARY_NAME: "helloworld"

# Define the build job
build:
  stage: build
  image: golang:latest  # Use the official Golang Docker image
  script:
    # Fetch dependencies
    - go mod download
    # Build the Go application
    - go build -o $BINARY_NAME ./cmd/server/main.go 

# Define the release job
release:
  stage: release
  image: goreleaser/goreleaser:latest  # Use the official goreleaser Docker image
  # Only trigger the release job when the build job succeeds
  dependencies:
    - build
  script:
    # Run goreleaser for releasing the binary
    - goreleaser release --clean
